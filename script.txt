Demonstrate actors through a coding example
Actors are a good abstraction for parallelization where some state is involved. 
Probabably there are two main broad categories of application: 
	1) where there is a large amount of work to be spread out over a wide range of processors
	2) where you want to simulate a large interacting network of independent agents

Actors are created (and therefore supervised) in a strictly hierarchical fashion but subsequent communication is entirely open. 
Actors are location independent so they can communicate with each other across servers.
The Fight Club rules:
	1) You do not pass mutable data in messages
	2) you do NOT PASS mutable data in messages
	
The contract with an actor is as follows: They can be coded as if they are operating in a single-threaded enviroment. They process their messages to completion and typically respond by sending another message.
